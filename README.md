## Overview

**LavaLust** is an open-source PHP framework that follows the **MVC (Model–View–Controller)** architectural pattern. It is designed for developers who need a structured, maintainable, and scalable foundation — without the bloat of heavier modern frameworks.

Whether you are building a simple web application, a REST API, or a teaching project, LavaLust provides the right tools with minimal friction.

---

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **MVC Architecture** | Clean separation of Models, Views, and Controllers for organized, maintainable code |
| **Built-in Routing** | Flexible URL routing that maps requests to controllers with minimal configuration |
| **Libraries & Helpers** | Reusable components for sessions, forms, validation, and database access |
| **Modular Design** | Scalable structure that supports clean organization as your application grows |
| **REST API Support** | First-class support for building RESTful APIs using LavaLust conventions |
| **ORM-like Models** | Simplified, readable database interaction without a heavy abstraction layer |

---

## Requirements

- PHP 7.4 or higher
- A web server with URL rewriting support (Apache `.htaccess` or Nginx config)
- Composer (optional, for dependency management)

---

## Installation

**Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ronmarasigan/lavalust.git
cd lavalust
```

**Or download a release directly:**

```bash
wget https://github.com/ronmarasigan/lavalust/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
unzip main.zip
```

Configure your web server to point to the project root and ensure `mod_rewrite` (Apache) or equivalent is enabled.

## Quick Start

### 1. Define a Route

**File:** `app/config/routes.php`

```php
$router->get('/', 'Welcome::index');
$router->get('/about', 'Welcome::about');
$router->post('/users/store', 'Users::store');
```

### 2. Create a Controller

**File:** `app/controllers/Welcome.php`

```php
<?php

class Welcome extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        $data['title'] = 'Home';
        $this->call->view('welcome', $data);
    }

    public function about()
    {
        $this->call->view('about');
    }
}
```

### 3. Create a View

**File:** `app/views/welcome.php`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title><?= $title ?></title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to LavaLust Framework</h1>
    <p>Lightweight. Fast. MVC.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### 4. Create a Model

**File:** `app/models/User_model.php`

```php
<?php

class User_model extends Model
{
    protected $table = 'users';

    public function getAll()
    {
        return $this->db->table($this->table)->get()->getResult();
    }

    public function findById(int $id)
    {
        return $this->db->table($this->table)
                        ->where('id', $id)
                        ->get()
    }
}
```

## Configuration

### Database

**File:** `app/config/database.php`

```php
$database['main'] = array(
    'driver'	=> '',
    'hostname'	=> getenv('DB_HOST') ?: '',
    'port'		=> getenv('DB_PORT') ?: '',
    'username'	=> getenv('DB_USERNAME') ?: '',
    'password'	=> getenv('DB_PASSWORD') ?: '',
    'database'	=> getenv('DB_NAME') ?: '',
    'charset'	=> '',
    'dbprefix'	=> '',
    // Optional for SQLite
    'path'      => ''
);
```

### Base URL

**File:** `app/config/config.php`

```php
$config['base_url'] = 'http://localhost:3000/';
```

---

## Building a REST API

LavaLust supports REST API development out of the box. Controllers can return JSON responses for API endpoints.

```php
<?php

class Api extends Controller
{
    $this->call->library('api');

    public function users()
    {
        $this->api->require_method('GET');
        $auth = $this->api->require_jwt(); 

        $this->call->model('User_model');
        $users = $this->User_model->getAll();

        $this->api->respond(['data' => $users]);
    }
}
```

Route definition:

```php
$router->get('/api/users', 'Api::users');
```

---

## Philosophy

LavaLust is built on a single principle: **minimal core, maximum control.**

Modern frameworks often add layers of abstraction that benefit large enterprise teams but get in the way of developers who want to understand exactly what their code is doing. LavaLust provides structure and utilities without hiding the underlying logic — making it an excellent choice for:

- **Rapid prototyping** — Get an application running in minutes
- **Learning MVC** — Understand how each architectural layer works
- **Lightweight production apps** — Deploy without dragging in unused dependencies
- **Teaching PHP development** — Clear conventions, readable source code
